PHP ProcessManager for ReactPHP
===============================

This is the library used in my blog entry about high performance PHP applications.

First initial version. Final version will be pushed when the blog entry is published.

Example:

```bash
$ ./bin/ppm start ~/bude/symfony-24/ --bridge=symfony
```
